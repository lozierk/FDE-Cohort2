## Stage 1: the database
- **I decided:**
- **I predicted:**
- **What happened (paste output):**

## Stage 2: the tools, and where access control lives
- **Before reading SPEC R-1, I thought ownership belonged in:**
- **I decided:**
- **What happened (order 5 as alice):**

## Stage 3: the agent, and a bare CLI
- **I decided (tools loaded, how the email is bound):**
- **I predicted the "order 5 for bob" request would:**
- **What happened:**

## Stage 4: the pipeline and its events
- **My hand-sketched CLI lines:**
- **I predicted the first event after the agent stage would be:**
- **What happened:**

## Stage 5: one trace per turn
- **I decided (what goes in span attributes, who can see Phoenix):**
- **Trace id:**
- **One thing the trace showed that the reply didn't:**

## Stage 6: Sanitizer and Security Judge
- **I decided (who may block, which A2A method):**
- **Predicted vs actual X01 latency:**
- **When I stopped the Judge, my pipeline first:**
- **Failing trajectory saved at:**

## Stage 7: the Guardrail
- **Three messages that must pass / three that must not (written before the prompt):**
- **False blocks / off-topic blocks, per prompt version:**

  | Version | What I changed | Legit false blocks | Off-topic blocked |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | v1 | | | |

## Stage 8: Masker and memory
- **I decided (what counts as PII, the cutoff):**
- **My planted memory's score, and whether my cutoff kept it:**
- **What the Masker reported on my PII test:**

## Stage 9: the web UI
- **My sketch, in words:**
- **Something the UI shows that the CLI doesn't (feature or leak?):**

## Stage 10: the eval runner
- **How I handled the memory waits:**
- **First run's failing rows, and what I changed:**
- **Second run: see `reports/eval.json` (don't retype numbers here).**
- **Successful turn I read end to end (trace id), and what it taught me:**
- **Failing turn I read end to end (trace id), and what it taught me:**
